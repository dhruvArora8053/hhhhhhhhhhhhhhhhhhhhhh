<!-- we need to tell the browser that this uses the html document -->

<html lang="en">
<!-- on what language this webpage has been written -->

<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<!-- metadata means the data about the data -->
<!-- utf-8 all the simple characters that we use in the english language -->

<!-- head tag is for the things that are not visible in the browser window -->

<!-- nav tag stands for navigation -->

<!-- header tag means the top part of the web document -->

<!-- article tag is yet another container element, it is used for like a computer is an article or a pen or a phone so all of these are articles and if somehow we needed to represent a computer in HTML then article would also be a good element for that -->

<!-- the aside element is usually used for some secondary information that compliments the information in the main part of the page -->
